# Dungeons and Dragons Character Creator

Like to play D&D but are terrible at going through handbooks? What if you don't have enough D6es? <br>
I encountered the same problems as a youth, and wanted to make a simple and offline tool which would enable me<br>
to create a character without all the hassle. 

To install, simply download the EXE Production file, and then save it to a directory. Enter that directory, and run the file.<br>
You'll be welcomed with a simple gui which will help you make your character. After finishing, it will give you the location of your character.

For Python (AKA Mac/Linux users) you should just download the D and D Class Maker folder. Then, after checking if you have all the dependencies installed <br>
you should just be able to run the Python file.
