# Dungeons and Dragons Character Creator

Like to play D&D but are terrible at going through handbooks? What if you don't have enough D6s? <br>
I encountered the same problem (occasionally), and wanted to make a simple and offline tool which would enable me<br>
to create a character without all the hassle. *cough* D&D Beyond *cough*

# Windows Users: ü™ü 
To install, simply download the EXE Production file, and then save it to a directory. Enter that directory, and run the .exe file.<br>
You'll be welcomed with a simple gui which will help you make your character. After finishing, it will give you the location of your character.

# Python Users (AKA MAC + GNU/Linux)
You should just download the D and D Class Maker folder. Unzip It.  
<br>Then, you should just be able to run either the Python file or the .sh file!
